# Auditory

Auditory is a CRUD API project designed to facilitate the integration of Spotify data into a PostgreSQL database through RESTful API endpoints. By leveraging the Spotify API, Auditory provides a set of endpoints for fetching specific information, such as artists, albums, tracks, and playlists, and seamlessly inserts this data into your database.

The point of it all was to scratch an itch (of course), which was - brushing up on Node again - using PostgreSQL - finally having a way of knowing what music I have and which I don't

This is pure backend, and you can operate it using Postman.

#### You need a Spotify Developer Account as well as a Google Developer account (for all the keys)

## Getting Started

      cd Auditory
      ```
2. **Install all dependencies:**

`

## Project Setup

### Setting up your PostgreSQL database

In order to use PostgreSQL, you need to install it via:

```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

on a Mac, or for Linux by visiting this link:

[Installing PostgreSQL on Linux](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)

After installation, connect to default database via

```bash
psql postgres
```

Now, create a new role with a new password - those data points should be put into the .env file

```bash
postgres=# CREATE ROLE DB_USER WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
```

and then

```bash
postgres=# ALTER ROLE DB_USER CREATEDB;
```

run

```bash
postgres=#\du
```

and then exit the default session with

```bash
postgres=#\q
```

Now, you can connect your new user "me" to the database

```bash
psql -d postgres -U me
```

With the new user, you can go ahead an create a new database - also save the name as DB_DATABASE in your .env file

```bash
postgres=> CREATE DATABASE DB_DATABASE;
```

and connect to it

```bash
postgres=>\c DB_DATABASE;
```

With the `CREATE TABLE` command you now have to create at least three tables: **artists**, **albums** and **tracks**

Here is an example:

```bash
CREATE TABLE artists (
    artist_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    genres VARCHAR[],
    album_ids VARCHAR[],
    more_info VARCHAR(255),
    harddrive BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Artist Table

| artist_id (VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY) | artist (VARCHAR(255)) | genres (VARCHAR[]) | album_ids (VARCHAR[]) | more_info (VARCHAR(255)) | harddrive (VARCHAR(255))                            |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| The artist's ID                       | The artist's name     | An array of genres | an array of album IDs | an href value            | a Boolean if that artist is saved on your harddrive |

### Tracks Table

| artist_id (VARCHAR(255)) | track (VARCHAR(255)) | duration (VARCHAR(255))   | albumid (VARCHAR(255))              | youtube_url (VARCHAR(255))     | track_id (VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY) |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| The artist's ID          | the track title      | Duration in mins and secs | the id of the album the track is on | the songs probably youtube url | the track's ID                       |

### Albums Table

| albumid (VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY) | albumname (VARCHAR(255)) | artist_id (VARCHAR(255)) | tracks (VARCHAR(255)) | releasedate (DATE)              | track_ids (VARCHAR[])                   | album_type (VARCHAR(255))    | harddrive (VARCHAR(255))                            | image (VARCHAR(255)) |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| the album's ID                      | the album's name         | The artist's ID          | Number of tracks      | the date of the album's release | an array of all the album's tracks' IDs | single, album or compilation | a Boolean if that artist is saved on your harddrive | an image url         |

### Environment

In order to use the endpoints, you need to create a .env file for your secrets.
There you need to save the following data:

      - API_KEY (for YouTube API)
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID (Spotify Developer Account)
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
      - DB_PASSWORD (for your PostgreSQL database)
      - DB_USER
      - DB_HOST
      - DB_DATABASE
      - DB_PORT

### Using the CRUD

I mean, have fun with it! I'm using it on localhost, of course, since it's purely for personal database reasons I wrote this.
The next step would be a nice front end so that Postman can rest for a while (pun intended.)
